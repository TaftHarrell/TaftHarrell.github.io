Regions colored a darker shade of red, such as Florida, Louisiana, and the coast of many Southern states, have seen many hurricanes. States farther to the North and West are white or a light shade of red, and have seen few hurricanes. However, as time has gone on, these states start to become a darker shade of red, as climate change causes hurricanes to move more inland."></div>

        <summary id="About">About this Visualization</summary>
        <p  id="aboutDescription">This vis was designed by two students at Davidson College, Frank Howden and Taft Harrell.
            Our intention with this visualization was to show that hurricanes have been moving more inland over time. This vis only displays
            data for the general area around the United States, so you many notice that some of the hurricanes (represented by a blue
            dot) will not immediately be displayed on the map when using the hurricane selector tool.</p>

        <summary id="Data">The Data</summary>
        <p  id="dataDescription"> We used data from the HURDAT2 1851 - 2024 dataset, compiled by the National Hurricane Center and NOAA, which can be found 
           <a href=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat>here</a>. We specifically used data attributes such as longitude, latitude, maximum 
        sustained wind of the storm, status of system, and more. You can see our formatted data below: </p>
        <table id="dataTable"></table>

        <details>
            <summary id="Limitations">Limitations</summary>
            <p id="limitationsDescription">We had to estimate hurricane raddi, as the 
            HURDAT2 1851 - 2024 dataset only contained hurricane raddi for roughly the last 20 years. Hurricane raddi
            were estimated under the following criteria: Tropical Depression = 10; Tropical Storm = 50; Category 1
            Hurricane = 100; Category 2 Hurricane = 150; Category 3 Hurricane = 200; Category 4 Hurricane = 250; 
            Category 5 Hurricane = 300. Although typically the more intense the hurricane it is, the smaller its radius,
            the data was best displayed visually under this convention. Furthermore, this convention ensures a consistent
            method.
